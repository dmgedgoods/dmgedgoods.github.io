### Project Brief: The No-BS Construction Management Platform

Let's be honest, most construction management software is a bloated, overpriced mess. You pay a fortune for a hundred features you'll never use, and the whole thing runs slower than molasses in January. It’s built by committees in corner offices who haven't stepped on a job site in years.

I got fed up with it. So, I built my own.

This is a ground-up construction management platform with all the core functionality of something like Buildertrend, but without the fluff. Using **Python**, **SQLite**, and **HTMX**, it's ridiculously fast and responsive. There are no clunky JavaScript frameworks, just a tool that does what you need it to do—scheduling, daily logs, client communication, financials—and gets out of your way. The goal here isn't to reinvent the wheel; it's to build a better, leaner wheel for the GCs who are tired of paying for a fleet of 18-wheelers when all they need is a reliable work truck. I will update with a better breakdown as time permits. Here are some screenshots for now. 

A nice little login page. IAM is important and security of this application is paramount.

I created a robust landing page with buckets. This is like a kanban for contractors. This is a powerful feature that helps keep the organizational juices flowing.

This is our scheduling module. This is a powerhouse for the contractor and helps keep things moving. Creating quality Gantt charts with milestones and proper flow are something clients crave these days. We also have a powerful table view that allows inline editing. The PDF exports are a great summarization of where you are on your project.
