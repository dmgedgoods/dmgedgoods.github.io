### Project Brief: Offline, HIPAA-Compliant Transcription

If your research involves Protected Health Information (PHI), sending audio files to a cloud transcription service is just asking for a HIPAA violation. It’s a massive liability. All it takes is one breach at some third-party AI company and your university is facing seven-figure fines and a complete loss of trust. It's a non-starter.

This project was born from that simple reality.

I'm developing a fully **offline transcription solution** for a local university's research department. The entire process—from audio input to the finished text document—happens on a single, air-gapped machine. The data **never** touches the internet. It doesn't get sent to a server in some unknown data center for processing; it stays local and secure. This isn't just a feature; it's the entire point. It provides researchers with the power of modern transcription technology without forcing them to gamble with patient privacy and compliance.
