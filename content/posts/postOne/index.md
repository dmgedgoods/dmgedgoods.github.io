I had a thought while working project management years ago for a construction company in the Bay Area: contractors are
great at their jobs. However they are not the most technologically savvy people around.

There was a huge problem at this company. The entire operational structure of the organization was built on spreadsheets.
Hundreds, if not thousands of spreadsheets, everywhere. Zero tracking. Zero version control. Accounting, job
tracking, vendor management, customer management, etc...all of it was a mess.
