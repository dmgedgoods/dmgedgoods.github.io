      <title>Offline Transcription Workflow</title>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;project-brief-offline-hipaa-compliant-transcription&#34;&gt;Project Brief: Offline, HIPAA-Compliant Transcription&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your research involves Protected Health Information (PHI), sending audio files to a cloud transcription service is just asking for a HIPAA violation. It’s a massive liability. All it takes is one breach at some third-party AI company and your university is facing seven-figure fines and a complete loss of trust. It&amp;rsquo;s a non-starter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project was born from that simple reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m developing a fully &lt;strong&gt;offline transcription solution&lt;/strong&gt; for a local university&amp;rsquo;s research department. The entire process—from audio input to the finished text document—happens on a single, air-gapped machine. The data &lt;strong&gt;never&lt;/strong&gt; touches the internet. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t get sent to a server in some unknown data center for processing; it stays local and secure. This isn&amp;rsquo;t just a feature; it&amp;rsquo;s the entire point. It provides researchers with the power of modern transcription technology without forcing them to gamble with patient privacy and compliance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>From Codebase to Construction Site: Building an AI to Navigate the Maze of Building Codes</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/projects/projecttwo/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Every general contractor has the same problem. It&amp;rsquo;s not manpower or material
costs. It&amp;rsquo;s the building department. Specifically building codes. A wall of text
that seems impossible to fully wrap your head around, let alone decypher and get
effective answer from. Sometimes a simple question can bog the entire job down;
waiting for building officials to respond with pertinent, objective answers can
take days, even weeks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>From Wall Street to Main Street</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I used to build houses. I was pretty good at it, believe it or not. My formative
years in the military were squeezed in between years of building, managing and
struggling in the construction industry. It&amp;rsquo;s a hard life, but the pay can be
great and there is something to be said about building a physical thing that
will be around for a long time. Craftsmanship is a unique trait, and the trades
are where some of the most amazing things get built. Perhaps it may be common
knowledge that the trades are notoriously averse to the tides of technology,
perhaps not. I would argue that for being such a large sector of small
businesses, there is a problem with the adoption of technology. According to the
Small Business Administration, greater that 10% of all small to medium sized
businesses are in the construction sector. Even more astounding is that about
99.9% of all construction companies are considered small to medium sized
businesses. So, being conservative with our math, if about 45% of SMBs make up
the GDP of the United States, we can assume about 4-5% of GDP comes from this
uniquely small construction sector. This is not trivial.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Bespoke Construction Management</title>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;project-brief-the-no-bs-construction-management-platform&#34;&gt;Project Brief: The No-BS Construction Management Platform&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s be honest, most construction management software is a bloated, overpriced mess. You pay a fortune for a hundred features you&amp;rsquo;ll never use, and the whole thing runs slower than molasses in January. It’s built by committees in corner offices who haven&amp;rsquo;t stepped on a job site in years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got fed up with it. So, I built my own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a ground-up construction management platform with all the core functionality of something like Buildertrend, but without the fluff. Using &lt;strong&gt;Python&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;SQLite&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;HTMX&lt;/strong&gt;, it&amp;rsquo;s ridiculously fast and responsive. There are no clunky JavaScript frameworks, just a tool that does what you need it to do—scheduling, daily logs, client communication, financials—and gets out of your way. The goal here isn&amp;rsquo;t to reinvent the wheel; it&amp;rsquo;s to build a better, leaner wheel for the GCs who are tired of paying for a fleet of 18-wheelers when all they need is a reliable work truck. I will update with a better breakdown as time permits. Here are some screenshots for now.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Securing the BIM Pipeline</title>

&lt;p&gt;I was talking with a small engineering firm a while back about a project that went sideways. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t a big, dramatic failure. It was subtle. A set of plans sent to a fabricator had a few critical dimensions that were off by just enough to cause a massive headache on-site. The change wasn&amp;rsquo;t caught in the shop drawings, and the result was thousands of dollars in rework and a client who was, to put it mildly, not thrilled.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>IAM Management for the Small Guys</title>

&lt;p&gt;An employee quits on a Friday. On Monday, you find out your main client list has been deleted from the company Dropbox. Who did it? You have no idea, because five different people all use the same &lt;code&gt;admin@&lt;/code&gt; login.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;rsquo;t a hypothetical. For small businesses, this kind of chaos is frighteningly common. We often operate on trust, giving everyone the keys to everything because it’s &amp;ldquo;easier.&amp;rdquo; This isn&amp;rsquo;t just lazy; it&amp;rsquo;s a massive, self-inflicted wound waiting to happen.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Domain Squatting, BEC, Fake Invoices...oh my</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;About a year ago I had a friend call me with a minor concern. They worked for a
reputable general contractor that worked with some very high-end clients.
Incredibly wealthy is what that means. They were wondering how an email could
appear to have come from one of the managers of the company requesting payment
from a client. This piqued my interest. Honestly I had a hard time wrapping my
head around the circumstances, as the timeline was not explained well. I will
attempt to do a better job explaining it below:&lt;/p&gt;</description>
