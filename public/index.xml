      <description>&lt;p&gt;I used to build houses. I was pretty good at it, believe it or not. My formative
years in the military were squeezed in between years of building, managing and
strugling in the construction industry. It&amp;rsquo;s a hard life, but the pay can be
great and there is something to be said about building a physical thing that
will be around for a long time. Craftsmanship is a unique trait, and the trades
are where some of the most amazing things get built. Perhaps it may be common
knowledge that the trades are notoriously averese to the tides of technology,
perhaps not. I would argue that for being such a large sector of small
businesses, there is a problem with the adoption of technology. According to the
Small Business Administration, greater that 10% of all small to medium sized
businesses are in the construction sector. Even more astounding is that about
99.9% of all construction companies are considered small to medium sized
businesses. So, being conservative with our math, if about 45% of SMBs make up
the GDP of the United States, we can assume about 4-5% of GDP comes from this
uniquely small construction sector. This is not trivial.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
