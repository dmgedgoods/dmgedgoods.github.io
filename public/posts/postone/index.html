  <div class="post-content"><p>I used to build houses. I was pretty good at it, believe it or not. My formative
years in the military were squeezed in between years of building, managing and
strugling in the construction industry. It&rsquo;s a hard life, but the pay can be
great and there is something to be said about building a physical thing that
will be around for a long time. Craftsmanship is a unique trait, and the trades

Small Business Administration, greater that 10% of all small to medium sized
businesses are in the construction sector. Even more astounding is that about
99.9% of all construction companies are considered small to medium sized

the GDP of the United States, we can assume about 4-5% of GDP comes from this
uniquely small construction sector. This is not trivial.</p>
<p>When most people think of cybersecurity or hear about a cyberattack, visions of
global banks and Fortune 500 companies come to mind. &ldquo;Big Tech, Inc. just lost
all their user data to an attack; move on, nothing to see.&rdquo; This is not
necessarily wrong, but it leaves a critical factor out of the equation. There is
a prevailing mindset that small businesses on Main Street are simply too small
to be a target. If 45% of the economy is too small to be a target, I have a
bridge in San Francisco for sale. The sad truth is that these small businesses
<em>are</em> prime targets for cyberattacks. Maybe not from nation state actors, but
cybercriminals are actively taking advantage of this market segment. Even worse,
one of the fastest growing targets in this target rich environment is the
construction sector.</p>
<p>The constrcution industry has long been defined by physical risk and hard
assets. The rapid digitization of the sector has created a perfect storm
enabling cybercriminals to capitalize like never before. This hits home for me.
I work with sever organizations in the space, helping them get this digital
tranformation doen in a secure and functional way. Their bottom line is my
bottom line. For years the risk management has been focused on the job site, and
to an extent it still should be. However the single biggest threat we see today
isn&rsquo;t somebody falling off the scaffolding; it&rsquo;s a phishing email.</p>
<p>In an already risky industry, there are new hurdles that must be overcome. We
have a huge rush towards digitization while simultaneously suffering from
cultural lag: the risk profile is exploding. The immense pressure companies feel
to get on board with new technologies is creating an inherently insecure
situation. There is a &ldquo;move fast and break stuff&rdquo; vibe going on, and not on
purpose. Insecure deployments, IoT, new BIM technologies yet to be vetted by
industry, all of which are creating a digital attack surface ripe for
exploitation. A digital attack surface where one simply did not exist a decade
ago. This is a scary new landscape for organizations that still can&rsquo;t grasp the
sensitivity of much of their data. There are tons of PII, confidential data, IP
and multi-million dollar financial transactions. Couple this with the immense
operational tempo of the industry and you have a perfect storm ripe for
criminals to take advantage of. If you have to shutdown operations because of
ransomware, this is the industry that is most likely to pay. Time is money.</p>
<p>There is a rapid rise in cybercrime in the construction industry. This is a fact
that can no longer be avoided. 60% of small businesses that suffer a cyberattack
with fold&hellip;disappear, gone forever. In the construction sector alone, data
breaches have increased 800% between 2019 and 2020 alone. Incident response
cases have doubled. There has been an outsized increase in phishing. Business
email compromise is easy money for these criminals. Construction is tied with
manufacturing as the top target for ransomware. The data is screaming at us to
do something. Threat actors have identified the construction industry as a prime
target for exploitation and are not waiting for us to catch up. This problem is
accelerating, don&rsquo;t wait to become a statistic. For an industry that so easily
manages complex tasks, we should be able to apply that same discipline to this
staggering problem.</p>
