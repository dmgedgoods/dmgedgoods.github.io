I was pretty good at it, believe it or not. My formative years in the military were squeezed in between years of building, managing and struggling in the construction industry. It\u0026rsquo;s a hard life, but the pay can be great and there is something to be said about building a physical thing that will be around for a long time. Craftsmanship is a unique trait, and the trades are where some of the most amazing things get built. Perhaps it may be common knowledge that the trades are notoriously averse to the tides of technology, perhaps not. I would argue that for being such a large sector of small businesses, there is a problem with the adoption of technology. According to the Small Business Administration, greater that 10% of all small to medium sized businesses are in the construction sector. Even more astounding is that about 99.9% of all construction companies are considered small to medium sized businesses. So, being conservative with our math, if about 45% of SMBs make up the GDP of the United States, we can assume about 4-5% of GDP comes from this uniquely small construction sector. This is not trivial.\nWhen most people think of cybersecurity or hear about a cyberattack, visions of global banks and Fortune 500 companies come to mind. \u0026ldquo;Big Tech, Inc. just lost all their user data to an attack; move on, nothing to see.\u0026rdquo; This is not necessarily wrong, but it leaves a critical factor out of the equation. There is a prevailing mindset that small businesses on Main Street are simply too small to be a target. If 45% of the economy is too small to be a target, I have a bridge in San Francisco for sale. The sad truth is that these small businesses are prime targets for cyberattacks. Maybe not from nation state actors, but cybercriminals are actively taking advantage of this market segment. Even worse, one of the fastest growing targets in this target rich environment is the construction sector.\nThe construction industry has long been defined by physical risk and hard assets. The rapid digitization of the sector has created a perfect storm enabling cybercriminals to capitalize like never before. This hits home for me. I work with sever organizations in the space, helping them get this digital transformation done in a secure and functional way. Their bottom line is my bottom line. For years the risk management has been focused on the job site, and to an extent it still should be. However the single biggest threat we see today isn\u0026rsquo;t somebody falling off the scaffolding; it\u0026rsquo;s a phishing email.\nIn an already risky industry, there are new hurdles that must be overcome. We have a huge rush towards digitization while simultaneously suffering from cultural lag: the risk profile is exploding. The immense pressure companies feel to get on board with new technologies is creating an inherently insecure situation. There is a \u0026ldquo;move fast and break stuff\u0026rdquo; vibe going on, and not on purpose. Insecure deployments, IoT, new BIM technologies yet to be vetted by industry, all of which are creating a digital attack surface ripe for exploitation. A digital attack surface where one simply did not exist a decade ago. This is a scary new landscape for organizations that still can\u0026rsquo;t grasp the sensitivity of much of their data. There are tons of PII, confidential data, IP and multi-million dollar financial transactions. Couple this with the immense operational tempo of the industry and you have a perfect storm ripe for criminals to take advantage of. If you have to shutdown operations because of ransomware, this is the industry that is most likely to pay. Time is money.\nThere is a rapid rise in cybercrime in the construction industry. This is a fact that can no longer be avoided. 60% of small businesses that suffer a cyberattack with fold\u0026hellip;disappear, gone forever. In the construction sector alone, data breaches have increased 800% between 2019 and 2020 alone. Incident response cases have doubled. There has been an outsized increase in phishing. Business email compromise is easy money for these criminals. Construction is tied with manufacturing as the top target for ransomware. The data is screaming at us to do something. Threat actors have identified the construction industry as a prime target for exploitation and are not waiting for us to catch up. This problem is accelerating, don\u0026rsquo;t wait to become a statistic. For an industry that so easily manages complex tasks, we should be able to apply that same discipline to this staggering problem.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/from-wall-street-to-main-street/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI used to build houses.

It wasn\u0026rsquo;t a big, dramatic failure. It was subtle. A set of plans sent to a fabricator had a few critical dimensions that were off by just enough to cause a massive headache on-site. The change wasn\u0026rsquo;t caught in the shop drawings, and the result was thousands of dollars in rework and a client who was, to put it mildly, not thrilled.\nThe firm swore the models were correct when they left their server. The fabricator swore they built to the plans they received. So what happened? Honestly, we\u0026rsquo;ll probably never know for sure, but it raised a terrifying question: what if someone had quietly intercepted and altered that data?\nThis is the new reality for architects, engineers, and contractors. Your BIM pipeline—the digital lifeblood of your projects—is a massive target. It’s packed with intellectual property, client data, and project details that are incredibly valuable. And for a bad actor, messing with a small firm is often easier and just as profitable as going after a big one.\nThe problem is, most small firms think their standard antivirus or just using Autodesk\u0026rsquo;s cloud is enough. They\u0026rsquo;re wrong. That’s like locking your front door but leaving all the windows wide open. Here’s a no-nonsense look at where you should really be focusing your energy.\nIt Starts With Your People (It Almost Always Does) The weakest link in any security chain is usually a person who clicks on something they shouldn\u0026rsquo;t. You can have the best firewall in the world, but it won\u0026rsquo;t stop an employee from giving away their password in a convincing phishing email.\nMulti-Factor Authentication (MFA): I\u0026rsquo;m going to be blunt. If you are not using MFA on your email, your cloud BIM platform (ACC, Trimble, etc.), and anything else you can, you are being negligent. Full stop. It’s the single best, and often free, tool to stop an account from being hijacked.\nStop Reusing Passwords: Everyone knows this, and almost everyone is guilty of it. Use a password manager. It’s a simple fix for a catastrophic vulnerability.\nLocking Down the Models Themselves Your data needs to be protected, whether it\u0026rsquo;s sitting on your server or flying across the internet.\nAccess Control Isn\u0026rsquo;t a Suggestion: Does your intern really need admin-level access to the entire project folder? The \u0026ldquo;Principle of Least Privilege\u0026rdquo; sounds fancy, but it just means people should only be able to touch the files they absolutely need for their job. Audit these permissions regularly, and when someone leaves the company, their access should be cut off before they’re even out the door.\nBackups Are Your \u0026lsquo;Get Out of Jail Free\u0026rsquo; Card: Ransomware can and will happen to small firms. Without a recent, tested, and offline backup, your only choice is to pay the ransom or lose everything. Back up your data religiously.\nWhy Bother? Because the cost of failure is immense. It’s not just the financial hit from rework or a ransomware payment. It\u0026rsquo;s the catastrophic damage to your reputation. How do you explain to a high-end client that their project was delayed because your firm got hacked? You don’t. You just lose the client.\nSecuring your BIM pipeline isn\u0026rsquo;t some esoteric IT problem; it\u0026rsquo;s a core business function. The steps are straightforward and don\u0026rsquo;t require a massive budget. It just requires you to stop assuming you\u0026rsquo;re not a target and start acting like you are. This is just scratching the surface, but it\u0026rsquo;s a start.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/securing-the-bim-pipeline/","summary":"\u003ch3 id=\"your-bim-models-are-a-ticking-time-bomb\"\u003eYour BIM Models Are a Ticking Time Bomb\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was talking with a small engineering firm a while back about a project that went sideways.

Getting it right is not optional.\nHere’s the bare-minimum, no-excuses approach:\nOne Person, One Login. Period. Shared accounts for email, cloud storage, or critical software are a disaster. When something breaks or goes missing, you have zero accountability. It stops today. Every user gets their own unique login. No exceptions.\nStop Making Everyone an Admin. The new hire in marketing does not need the ability to delete the entire accounting folder. This isn\u0026rsquo;t about trust; it\u0026rsquo;s about limiting the \u0026ldquo;blast radius\u0026rdquo; of a mistake or a hacked account. Grant people the minimum access they need to do their job. If they need more, they can ask.\nHave an Exit Plan. When someone leaves your company, your first move—before the farewell lunch—should be to execute an offboarding checklist. Revoke their access to everything: email, shared drives, software licenses, Slack. Immediately. A disgruntled ex-employee with the keys is one of the biggest threats to your business.\nThis isn\u0026rsquo;t about creating corporate bureaucracy. It\u0026rsquo;s about control.

They worked for a reputable general contractor that worked with some very high-end clients. Incredibly wealthy is what that means. They were wondering how an email could appear to have come from one of the managers of the company requesting payment from a client. This piqued my interest. Honestly I had a hard time wrapping my head around the circumstances, as the timeline was not explained well. I will attempt to do a better job explaining it below:\nSo here is what I figured happened:\nA bad actor secured a domain that was the same as the innocent contractor. From here, they were able to target adjacent contractors for current jobs. They happened across a whale and proceeded to send an email requesting payment in an odd fashion from the money manager of a wealthy client. The astute people at that organization were able to spot something being off and responded accordingly; no payment was sent.\nThis is a common occurrence and we do what we can to mitigate and react to it. The outcome was a known quantity, to a certain extent, but I had questions. This felt incredibly targeted. How did an attacker know to pull that specific domain? How did the attacker know what clients were the best targets? Why was only one client in particular targeted? I was not in a position to further investigate the email traffic and try to find sources or IOC\u0026rsquo;s in any capacity, so that may be a story for another day.\nPerhaps the most prudent and concerning outcome from this attack was the response. The contractor who had their domain typosquatted by the bad actor has an MSP they have worked with for years. Their solution to this problem was to park the customer behind a barracuda network device in an effort to \u0026ldquo;save hunndreds of dollars in purchasing adjacently named domains\u0026rdquo;. This reeks of incompetence and I was honestly shocked. Simple, close to free solutions exist, right there attached to their domain. SPF, DKIM and DMARC help dramatically here. While you cannot stop people from buying domains, you and your friendly contacts can all use the aforementioned technologies to ensure your contact is trusted and secured.\nSPF (Sender Policy Framework): This is a free DNS record that lists all the IP addresses and servers authorized to send email on behalf of your domain. It\u0026rsquo;s like a bouncer\u0026rsquo;s guest list; if the sending server isn\u0026rsquo;t on the list, it\u0026rsquo;s suspicious. DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail): This is a free DNS record that adds a unique digital signature to every email you send. The receiving server checks this signature to ensure the email hasn\u0026rsquo;t been tampered with in transit. It\u0026rsquo;s like an unbroken wax seal on a letter. DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting \u0026amp; Conformance): This is the most critical piece. DMARC is a free DNS record that tells receiving email servers what to do if an email claims to be from you but fails the SPF or DKIM checks. Policy: You can set the policy to p=none (just monitor), p=quarantine (send to spam), or p=reject (block the email entirely). Reporting: DMARC sends you reports on who is sending email from your domain, allowing you to see if you\u0026rsquo;re being spoofed. If both senders and receivers implemented these measures, the majority of attacks like this wouldn\u0026rsquo;t even hit the inbox. I look forward to being able to do some more digging and analysis on their systems to better understand what really transpired\u0026hellip;this was an interesting case.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/bec-and-typosquatting/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAbout a year ago I had a friend call me with a minor concern.
